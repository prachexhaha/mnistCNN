- **Project Overview**:
  - Implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras.
  - Classifies images into 26 different categories (such as alphabet letters).

- **Model Architecture**:
  - **Input Shape**:
    - Images with a shape of (28, 28, 1), where 28x28 represents the pixel dimensions and 1 denotes a single color channel (grayscale).

  - **Layers**:
    1. **First Convolutional Layer (`Conv2D`)**:
       - **Filters**: 32
       - **Kernel Size**: 3x3
       - **Activation Function**: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
         - **Purpose**: Applies a non-linear transformation to the input data, allowing the network to learn complex patterns and features by introducing non-linearity.
    2. **Second Convolutional Layer (`Conv2D`)**:
       - **Filters**: 64
       - **Kernel Size**: 3x3
       - **Activation Function**: ReLU
         - **Purpose**: Further processes the features extracted by the first layer, enabling the detection of more complex shapes and patterns.
    3. **Max Pooling Layer (`MaxPooling2D`)**:
       - **Pool Size**: 2x2
       - **Purpose**: Reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, thereby lowering the number of parameters and computational cost while retaining essential spatial information.
    4. **Flatten Layer (`Flatten`)**:
       - Converts 2D feature maps into 1D feature vectors.
       - **Purpose**: Prepares the data for the fully connected layers by flattening the multi-dimensional array of features into a vector.
    5. **Fully Connected Layer (`Dense`)**:
       - **Units**: 128
       - **Activation Function**: ReLU
         - **Purpose**: Performs classification by combining and learning from all the features extracted by the convolutional layers, helping to capture intricate patterns and relationships in the data.
    6. **Dropout Layer (`Dropout`)**:
       - **Rate**: 0.2 (20% of the input units are randomly set to zero during training)
       - **Purpose**: Helps prevent overfitting by introducing noise during training, which forces the model to learn more robust features that generalize well to unseen data.
    7. **Output Layer (`Dense`)**:
       - **Units**: 26 (corresponding to the 26 classes)
       - **Activation Function**: Softmax
         - **Purpose**: Converts the output into a probability distribution over the 26 classes. The softmax function ensures that the sum of the probabilities for all classes is equal to 1, making it suitable for multi-class classification tasks. The class with the highest probability is chosen as the predicted label.

- **Benefits**:
  - **Efficient Training**: The use of multiple convolutional layers and pooling layers reduces the dimensionality of the data progressively, leading to faster and more efficient training.
  - **Accurate Classification**: By learning and generalizing features effectively through ReLU activation and regularization with dropout, the model achieves high accuracy in image classification.
  - **Robust Learning**: Dropout helps in creating a robust model that generalizes well to new data by preventing overfitting, which can occur when the model learns to memorize the training data instead of generalizing from it.
